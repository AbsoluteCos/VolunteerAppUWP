# VolunteerAppUWP
VolunteerApp is a Windows software made in C# and XAML with UWP and utilizes a SQL database.  VolunteerApp is designed to enable users to easily find volunteer oppurtunities, record oppurtunities, and talk about service.
## Map
The map is one of the tabs of VolunteerApp that plots clickable points on a map using the Bing Maps API and takes oppurtunites off the web with the Better Place API and from Volunteer.gov.  Clicking on an oppurtunity gives a Dialog with the title of the event and a description.
## Profile
The profile tab allows you to change your profile picture, log events to the SQL database, view past events recorded, view statics of the profile, view a graph of hours doing service for each month using Syncfusion, and log out.
## Community
The community tab allows you to view posts made by users and can be filitered by tags representing different issues that can be volunteered for.  It also has an area to create a new post with selected tags.
